These are some basic beginner scripts that will make your life in the Linux Command Line a bit easier and more relaxed.

Some of the aliases and scripts can aid in making newer users more comfortabe with the command line.

## Why use these scripts?

The contents of this repo contain scripts and aliases that may be useful to newbies in Linux. Commands such as ``rm`` can be intimidating due to their nature of being destructive and irreversible.

There are also some useful utilites such as sticky notes which can be helpful for productivity.

## Manual

### Scripts

#### rm command
- The traditional ``rm`` command is replaced with an alias which points to the [``logrm`` script.](./scripts/logrm.sh) The ``logrm`` script logs all deletions to a hidden file in the users home directory - ``.removelog``.
  - The ``logrm`` file then calls upon the ``newrm`` script described below, to perform the actual deletion of the selected file(s).
  - To skip logging, use the ``-s`` flag.
- The [``newrm`` script](./scripts/newrm.sh) replaces the traditional ``rm`` command with a script that automatically backs up all deleted items to a hidden directory in the home folder - ``$HOME/.deleted-files/``
  - To force a delete without backing up the file(s), use the regular ``rm`` command with the ``-f`` (force) flag. Ex: ``rm -f example.txt``

#### stickynote scripts
- Add a short note with ``addnote NOTE HERE``
  - To add a longer note, simply run ``addnote`` alone. The terminal will print a empty line for you to begin typing on. Once you are done, you can exit with ``^D``.
- To see your notes, you can just run ``check``.
  - To search for a specific note, you can run ``check SEARCH TERM HERE``, the entire line containing the term will be returned.
  - To remove a specific note, run ``check rm REMOVE TERM HERE``, and all lines containing that term will be removed.

#### logging scripts
- Logs each time you log into/log out of your machine.
- Logs are saved to ``$HOME/.loginlog``
- Logs are completely silent

### Aliases

#### cp and mv aliases
- The ``cp`` alias automatically enables the ``-i`` and ``-v`` flags. The ``-i`` flag will prompt you for confirmation when copying a file that will overwrite a pre-existing file, and the ``-v`` flag will always provide verbose output.
- The ``mv`` alias also automatically enables the ``-i`` and ``-v`` flags that do the same thing as the ``cp`` command.

#### Compatability with [dotfiles](https://github.com/5late/dotfiles)
- I have made the scripts compatible with [my fork of 0xMF's dotfiles](https://github.com/5late/dotfiles) if you have them installed.

#### Included Package Installer
- The installer in the script installs basic packages that most users will want on their system.
- **Please read [#packages](#packages) to see what packages are being installed.**

## Installation

Run the following commands to install the scripts.

``git clone https://github.com/5late/Newb-Config``

``cd Newb-Config``

``chmod a+x install.sh``

``./install.sh``

The script will prompt you for responses as it installs and copies config files. The script is made to be as modular as possible, with each part being able to be installed without another.

**INFO:** The script will *only* work with 'y'. Answers such as 'yes', 'ok', 'sure' will not be accepted.

After answering the prompts, the installation should be complete.

## Packages

**READ:** If you do not want any specific one of the packages, open the corresponding text file, and delete the line with the package you do not want.

#### General Installation

- Neofetch
  - Cool ASCII Art
  - Syncs with my fork of [dotfiles](https://github.com/5late/dotfiles) for log-in art

- Linux Logo
  - Cool ASCII Art (again)
  - Overrides Neofetch sync with my fork of [dotfiles](https://github.com/5late/dotfiles) for log-in art

- figlet
  - Text-to-Large-Letters formatter
  - Works alongside the neofetch/linux logo ascii art for my fork of [dotfiles](https://github.com/5late/dotfiles) for log-in art
